Run `npm i full-icu`

Feature Request:
- Add a feature to return the statement as an html.

Note:
- When you have to add a feature to a program but the code is not structured in a convenient way, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature.
- Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be selfÂ­checking.
